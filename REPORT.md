## Bugs and issues
Because this lab was mostly drawing the schematic, there weren't too many issues encountered. The main one would be making sure the bits on each side of the splitters lined up, as some of my constant values did not match the number of bits the splitter needed and thus gave me errors. Other than that, it was just meticulously following the mips data path while also tracing init.asm.
